    "You fly into the asteroid belt and reach the Ceres monitoring station. The Elves here have an emergency: they're having trouble tracking all of the asteroids and can't be sure they're safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elves would like to build a new monitoring station in a nearby area of space; they hand you a map of all of the asteroids in that region (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The map indicates whether each position is empty (`.`) or contains an asteroid (`#`). The asteroids are much smaller than they appear on the map, and every asteroid is exactly in the center of its marked position. The asteroids can be described with `X,Y` coordinates where `X` is the distance from the left edge and `Y` is the distance from the top edge (so the top-left corner is `0,0` and the position immediately to its right is `1,0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to figure out which asteroid would be the best place to build a ***new monitoring station***. A monitoring station can ***detect*** any asteroid to which it has ***direct line of sight*** - that is, there cannot be another asteroid ***exactly*** between them. This line of sight can be at any angle, not just lines aligned to the grid or diagonally. The ***best*** location is the asteroid that can ***detect*** the largest number of other asteroids.\n",

(The only asteroid it cannot detect is the one at `1,0`; its view of this asteroid is blocked by the asteroid at `2,2`.) All other asteroids are worse locations; they can detect `7` or fewer other asteroids. Here is the number of other asteroids a monitoring station on each asteroid could detect:\n",
