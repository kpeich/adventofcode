# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) Solutions

I wanted to start coding again back in 2019 and was looking for projects to do.
My friend [Brian](https://github.com/brianjp93) said he had a lot of fun doing these so I thought I'd give them a go.

All solutions are written in Python over the years
I sometimes go through my thought process and what did and didn't work for me in the notebooks in early years.
At some point I stopped doing that, maybe I'll do it again someday.

Big thanks to [Eric](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) for taking the time to entertain me with a bunch of puzzles. Also, sorry for violating the rules by having puzzle text in my repo.
