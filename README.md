# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) Solutions for 2019

I wanted to start coding again and was looking for projects to do.
My friend [Brian](https://github.com/brianjp93) said he had a lot of fun doing these so I thought I'd give them a go.

All solutions are written in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
I sometimes go through my thought process and what did and didn't work for me in the notebooks.

Big thanks to [Eric](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) for taking the time to entertain me with a bunch of puzzles.
